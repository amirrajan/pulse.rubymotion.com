Also, Redpotion is currently failing with Xcode 10 given an invalid regex match
in `ruby-xcdm`. The following PR does resolve the issue:
https://github.com/infinitered/ruby-xcdm/pull/24. The original regex assumed
that the Xcode version was only a single digit. Now we are up to two digits
with Xcode 10.0. While we wait for this to get merged in you can reference the
fork as a work around: https://github.com/Atastor/ruby-xcdm
